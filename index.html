        <h1>Nashville CTO Group</h1>
        <p>Initially modeled afer the NYC <a href="http://www.ctoschool.org/">CTO School</a>, the NCG is a meetup for CTOs, VP Eng,  or Tech Leads that are interested in improving their skills and learning from each other.  We are more focused on leadership in startups in terms of topic selection, but welcome all technologists.   We have become an ongoing forum for senior technical people to discuss their issues, meet each other, and share expertise.   Secondary goals is to help grow the Nashville technology and startup ecosystem by building better technical leadership capacity.</p>

      <h2>Who Can Join?</h2>
      <p>The ideal member is a CTO, VP. Eng, Architect, Technical Lead, or somebody with a few years of experience thatâ€™s on the cusp of becoming the technical lead.   Membership is by approval; we do not let in non-technical people, and try to gently discourage people who are just starting out their careers (though we sill let them in if they feel strongly about joining).     This is one of the ways we try to keep this group free of non-relevant content, including trying to keep recruiters and business people looking for technical co-founders away from this group.    We want this to be a group of peers who can really relate to each other.</p>
